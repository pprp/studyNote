# 需要准备的内容

### 1. 数据结构





### 2. 算法分析





### 3. 数字图像处理





### 4. 计算机视觉







### 5. 牛及其关键部位检测系统

我是这个项目的负责人，这个项目主要是采用深度学习的方法对牛面部关键部位进行目标检测。当时尝试了one-stage算法YOLOv3,SSD和two-stage算法Faster R-CNN等，最终考量到速度以及准确率两个因素，最终选择了YOLOv3作为实验的baseline, 我们跟进一些新的想法构建了一个基于YOLOv3的神经网络，主要改进了基础网络部分，使用当时最新的空洞卷积来改善感受野不足的问题；更改了特征融合的方式，由于待检测的目标很小，更需要结合更多浅层网络特征，所以在YOLO基础之上将深层得到的feature map和浅层的feature map进行再次融合，提升了小目标的准确率。

之后基于改进的神经网络结构开发了一个用于进行牛的面部关键点的软件Cow_detetor，并申请了软件著作权一项。

之后撰写了一篇文章“An improved Tiny YOLOv3 for Cattle Face and Facial Key Parts Detection” 一个学期加寒假，现在投的期刊是optik。处于with editor状态。

最终获得了优秀结题。

3分钟英文自我介绍+2分钟中文介绍

Good morning, everyone, I am very glad to be here for this interview. My name is Dong peijie from the Northwest A&F University. My major is Software engineering in College of information engineering.

In the first five semesters,  I got the first place in my major through my own efforts. I won a national scholarship and a president's scholarship.

what's more, I took part in some competitions such as MCM/ICM, Lan Qiao Competition and some other programming competition. Among these competitions,  what impressed me most was the future cup AI challenge. In this competition, our mission is to detect superstars. We have tried a lot of things, such as Digital image processing, GAN, YOLO, we finally chose Faster R-CNN as baseline to detect super star because its high performence. 

Finally, I participated in the science and innovation project as leader in my sophomore year. Its theme is "Design and implementation of detection system of cattle and its key parts". This is an object detection project. I independently developed the software Cow_detector and applied for the software copyright. I also write an article named "An Improved Tiny YOLOv3 for Cattle Face and Facial Key Parts Detection", and it is in with editor status.

  I think at present, I can do many things in a superficial level, but not be competent to do things professionally owing to lack of ample knowledge and ability. Because of this project, I became interested in computer vision and planned to continue my research in the postgraduate stage.

I will do my best in my postgraduate study. OK, that’s all. Thank you very much.
